abstract = {Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) has been under intensive investigation as a promising noninvasive biomedical imaging modality. Various acoustic detector arrays have been developed to achieve enhanced imaging performance. In this paper, we study the effect of the detection geometry on image quality through point spread function (PSF) modeling based on back-projection image reconstruction. Three commonly-used three-dimensional detection geometries, namely, spherical, cylindrical, and planar detector arrays, are investigated. The effect of detector bandwidth and aperture on PSF in these detection geometries is also studied. This work provides a performance evaluation tool for acoustic detector arrays used in PACT and can be helpful in the design and selection of detector arrays in practical imaging applications.},
